# Sorting and Searching in C++

This repository contains my implementations of various **Sorting** and **Searching** algorithms in C++.  
Each program is implemented with clear logic, examples, and easy-to-read code.



## 📂 Contents

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search** – Find element in a sorted array.
- **Linear Search** – Simple element search in any array.
- **Search in Infinite Sorted Array** – Handles unknown array sizes.
- **Count Total Occurrences** – Finds how many times an element appears.
- **Smallest Element in Rotated Sorted Array**
- **Search in Almost Sorted Array**

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms
- **Selection Sort**
- **Bubble Sort** 
- **Insertion Sort**
